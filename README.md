the name of the project is landing page.

this project contains sections and every section contains heading and paragraph.

by using Javascript, I contribute CSS to give styles to every section and to the navigation bar

i give class "Activable" to the sections that should be activated  and remove the class "Activable" from the sections that shouldn't be activated.

i solved the proplem and now every section in the navbar will destinate you to the section number that you clicked on.
